### Simple one way transcriber.

This is a simple transcriber that only uses one mic input to transcribe. It's more of a fun way to record DnD sessions and such. 

Simply put in how long do you want a quote/sentence to last per recording and the rest will be saved in Quotes.txt files. Make sure to save it under a different name later to not have it overwritten.

It transcribes in two languages, you can edit these in the main.py on line 30, 31 and 40, 41. If you want to transcribe different languages.
